Steps to Parse Logs:
Define Log Format:

Understand the structure of the log entries. Log entries typically have a specific format, and each field may be separated by a delimiter or follow a pattern.
Read Log File:

Open and read the log file. Depending on the programming language, you can use file reading functions to read the content.
Parse Log Entries:

Split each log entry into its components based on the defined format. Use string manipulation or regular expressions to extract relevant information.
Process Information:

Analyze and process the extracted information based on the requirements. This may involve counting occurrences, aggregating data, or performing specific calculations.
Output Results:

Display or store the parsed results. This could be printed to the console, written to another file, or sent to a database.
